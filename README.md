# PP5

## Goal

In this exercise you will:

* Use Git **locally** on your own machine: create branches, make commits, and merge them back.
* Set up and interact with a **bare** Git repository on an SSH‐accessible server (e.g. **vorlesungsserver**, or any machine you have SSH access to).
* Push and pull to/from **GitHub** and the **THGA GitLab** server.
* Practice **forking** an existing repo, making changes, and submitting a **Pull Request** (on GitHub) or **Merge Request** (on GitLab).

**Important:** Start a stopwatch when you begin and work uninterruptedly for **90 minutes**. Once time is up, stop immediately and document exactly where you had to pause.

---

## Workflow

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Modify & commit** your solution
3. **Submit your link for Review**

---

## Prerequisites

* Several starter repos are available here:
  [https://github.com/orgs/STEMgraph/repositories?q=Git%3A](https://github.com/orgs/STEMgraph/repositories?q=Git%3A)
* Ensure you have **SSH access** to a remote server (e.g., “vorlesungsserver”).
* Throughout, consult Git’s built-in man-pages (`git help <command>`) for explanations and options.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Local Git – Branching & Merging

1. Create a new directory in your home directory and initialize a repository in it. 
2. In one of your cloned repos, initialize a new branch called `feature-1`.
3. On `feature-1`, create a file `feature.txt` containing a short description of what you’re doing.
4. Commit your changes, then switch back to `master` (or `main`), and merge `feature-1` into your `master`.
5. Resolve any merge conflicts (if they arise) by hand, then commit the merge. 

**Your Commands & Output**

```bash
git status, git commit -m "1" , git config --global user.name "justin schulz" , git config --global user.email "justinschulz2014hotmail.de", git checkout -b master, git add feature.txt
On branch feature-1

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   feature.txt

[master (root-commit) c3f3352] 1
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 feature.txt

On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

### Task 2: Bare Repository on an SSH Server

1. On your SSH server (e.g., “vorlesungsserver”), create a **bare** repo at `~/repos/myproject.git`:

   ```bash
   ssh youruser@vorlesungsserver \
     "mkdir -p ~/repos/myproject.git && cd ~/repos/myproject.git && git init --bare"
   ```
2. On your local machine, add it as a remote named `origin-ssh`:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin-ssh youruser@vorlesungsserver:~/repos/myproject.git
   ```
3. Push your `master` branch to `origin-ssh`, then clone it into a fresh directory to verify.

**Your Commands & Output**

```bash

```
git clone pi@169.254.104.87:~/repos/myproject.git myproject_new, git push origin-ssh master, git remote add origin-ssh pi@169.254.104.87:~/repos/myproject.git, mkdir -p ~/repos/myproject.git && cd ~/repos/myproject.git && git init --bare

Cloning into 'myproject_new'...
remote: Objekte aufzählen: 3, Fertig.
remote: Zähle Objekte: 100% (3/3), Fertig.
remote: Komprimiere Objekte: 100% (2/2), Fertig.
remote: Gesamt 3 (Delta 0), Wiederverwendet 0 (Delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.

Everything up-to-date

### Task 3: GitHub & THGA GitLab

1. On [GitHub](github.com), create a new empty repo under your account named `myproject-gh`.
2. On [THGA GitLab](gitlab.thga.de), create a new project named `myproject-gl`.
3. In your local repository, add these as remotes:

   ```bash
   git remote add github  git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/myproject-gh.git
   git remote add gitlab  git@gitlab.thga.de:YOUR_USERNAME/myproject-gl.git
   ```
4. Push your `master` branch to both `github` and `gitlab` remotes.

> Hint: You are just adding two more bare-remotes to your already existing repository!

**Your Commands & Output**

```bash
# Paste here the remote‐adding & push outputs
```

---

### Task 4: Fork, Modify, and Pull/Merge Request

1. On GitHub, **fork** one of the repos from the STEMgraph org.
2. Clone your fork locally, create a branch `pp5-changes`, and make a small change (e.g., update the README).
3. Commit and push `pp5-changes` to **your** fork, then open a **Pull Request** against the original repo.
4. Repeat on THGA GitLab: fork another students repository, clone, branch, change, push, and open a **Merge Request**. If your peers opened a merge request to your repository, review and merge or decline it!

**Your PR/MR Links & Descriptions**

* GitHub PR: *paste URL and a one-sentence summary*
* GitLab MR: *paste URL and a one-sentence summary*

---

**Remember:** Stop working after **90 minutes** and record where you stopped!
